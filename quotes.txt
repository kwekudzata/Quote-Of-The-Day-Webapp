"The best way to predict the future is to create it."
"Dream big. Start small. Act now."
"Dont let yesterday take up too much of today."
"It always seems impossible until its done."
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
"Fall seven times and stand up eight."
"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."
"Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you."
"The harder you work for something, the greater youll feel when you achieve it."
"Success is not in what you have, but who you are."
"Dont wait for opportunity. Create it."
"Great things never come from comfort zones."
"Believe you can and youre halfway there."
"Small steps every day lead to big results."
